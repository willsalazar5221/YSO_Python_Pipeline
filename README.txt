Pipelines to analyze parameters outputted by the SED models. First, we note we will work in the directory YSOs > William_work > SED_Fitter_pars_analysis. 

First, we go into '1_pars_extractor'. We will see the pars files outputted by the SED fitter. These will be fed into pars_extractor_weighted_to_csv_disk_env.ipynb and pars_extractor_weighted_to_csv_disk_only.ipynb. Note for disk only models we use the latter code, while for with envelope models we use the former. These Jupyter Notebooks allow use to extract the parameters for each star using a weighting function based on the chi-squared for well-fitted models. Depending on whether the data is using IR only or with Gaia data points, the file outputted will be 'IR_**g04_extracted.csv'or 'Gaia_**g04_extracted.csv', where the ** indicates the model number. 

Next, in '2_pars_analysis', we have 'pars_analysis_V5_functions.ipynb' as the main Jupyter notebook. This will analyze the parameters we extracted from the first folder. Three functions are detailed within the notebook. These create plots of disk mass comparisons, HR diagrams, and model parameter comparisons. These plots can be saved as png files. Some of these functions may be changed and modified in the future for more streamlined access. 

The other notebook in this second folder is 'model_combine_v1_IR.ipynb'. This notebook combines the model sets based on a weighting parameter. For now, this only takes in the IR only csv files, however a Gaia notebook can be directly modelled after this one. The key output is a csv file 'IR_01_02_16_17_models.csv'. This contains the weighted parameters of the original extraction from folder one as well as a new column for the weighted parameters computed by weighting the models. 

The third Jupyter notebook in this folder is titled 'pars_model_combine_analysis_V1.ipynb'. This notebook is a work in progress left by me to pickup after the summer. This is a preliminary analysis of the weighted parameters created by the second notebook. A key plot is the residual plot, something to be analyzed and further built upon later. This uses a file named 'IR_02g04_pars_model_weight_new.csv' that is also in the directory. At the time I only combined two model sets. 

Isochrone files can also be found in this folder. They are used for the HR diagrams used in the first notebook.
